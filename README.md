# Krish's Assembly Endgame

A word guessing game with a programming twist — inspired by Hangman but set in a world where programming languages are fighting extinction. Built using React.js, styled with custom CSS, and enhanced with accessible design and game logic.

Guess letters to save languages from being eliminated. Play until you either guess the word or all the languages fall to Assembly.
